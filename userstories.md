As a user I should be able to click on squares and have a number revealed to me so I can look for matches.
As a user I should be able to find matches, and once a match is found those squares should disappear so I can continue playing.
As a user I should be able to reset the board once the game is over so I can play again without refreshing the page.
As a user I should be able to see how many matches I have made to keep track of my score.
As a user I should be able to play the game with randomized placement of the cards so the game isnt the same every time.
